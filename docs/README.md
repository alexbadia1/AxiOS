# AxiOS

AxiOS - a browser-based virtual Operating System in TypeScript

This was Alan's Operating Systems class initial project. See https://www.labouseur.com/courses/os/ for details. 
It was originally developed by Alan and then enhanced by Bob Nisco and Rebecca Murphy over the years. 

Contributions made by me:

- Console/CLI
  - Allow keyboard character input, (scrolling and line-wrap)
  - Defined console commands
    - run/stop process commands
    - Program scheduling commands such as round robin, priority, first come first serve, etc.
    - CRUD File System commands along with Defrag and chkdsk commands.
    - Other fun commands too!
- Simulated memory using a memory manager and memeory accessor, process control blocks, 
- Implemeneted 6502a machine language op codes to run on the simulated CPU
- Developed a CPU scheduler and tracked schedule turnaround time, wait time, and execution time
- Implemented context switching
- Developed a Disk System Device Driver to allow for File System siumulation
