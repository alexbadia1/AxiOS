/**
 * CPU SCHEDULER: Whenever the CPU becomes idle, the OS must select one of the processes 
 *                in the READY QUEUE to be executed.
 * READY QUEUE: All the processes are "lined-up" waiting for a chance to run on the CPU. 
 *      Various Implementations: 
 *          0.) First-in, Last-out (FIFO)
 *          1.) Priority Queue
 *          2.) Tree
 *          3.) Unordered Linked 
 *      Having a Ready Queue and Resident List should make calculating the AWT much easier 
 *      later... *Cough* *Cough* time spent in the ready queue *Cough* *Cough*
